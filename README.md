# :+1: nukem

This repo will automatically remove any `+1` comments from an issue, and aggreagate them on the original issue text:

![image of thumbs up reactions](https://cloudup.com/c19bnzKpBn1+)

Note that this is a bit hacky, because we can't use the "native" Github reactions. Upshot though: no more `+1` comments.

Downshot: you get all the emails still...
